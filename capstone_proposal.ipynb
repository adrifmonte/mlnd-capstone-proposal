Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.)\n",

The real estate area has been adopting machine learning to analyse historical data in that market and use several criterias to find a well balanced model to help predicting house prices.\n",

    "Personally, my main motivation for this particular problem is that I've talked to Loft's CTO in a local event at Sao Paulo - Brazil, and I've found out that [Loft uses machine learning to predict the house prices](https://blog.loft.com.br/entenda-como-a-loft-chega-no-valor-de-um-apartamento/) in their business, and it is a core value. I already knew about the [house prices kaggle getting started competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), but it hadn't took my attention until that moment. I realized it wasn't just a getting started challenge, it is actually a real world problem that real world companies need to solve."

Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable {the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms}, measurable {the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed}, and replicable {the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once}.)\n",

A great model will predict the house prices as closest as possible to its actual labelled price. The metric used as [evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview/evaluation) is the root mean squared error between the predicted log price and the actual labelled log price, so we have an error scaling equallity."

The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project."
